# Sail Boat Physics Simulation

This is a school project made for the course "Physics in Games" at BTH. The goal is to apply theories that were taught during the course into a game/simulation based on any large topics such as projectiles, boats, planes, rockets, collisions, etc.

I decided to make a sail boat physics simulation as I've wanted to learn more about different kinds of water systems, different kinds of air current systems, and perlin noise. These are some bigger concepts in games that are used a lot.
